st.markdown("""
    In this study, personal data are collected for our research. The use of personal or subject-related information is governed by the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and will be treated in accordance with the GDPR. This means that you can view, correct, restrict processing, and delete the data collected in this study. Only with your agreement, 
    we will log your input. We plan to publish the results of this and other research studies in academic articles or other media. Your data will not be retained for longer than necessary or until you contact researchers to have your data destroyed or deleted. Access to the raw data of the study 
    during the analysis is encrypted, password-protected and only accessible to the authors, colleagues, and researchers collaborating on this research. As part of the research, the data will be fully anonymized and then be made available to the general public, whereas no conclusions can be drawn about individual persons. Once the material has been made publicly available, 
    the distribution of the data can no longer be revoked. Since no contact details (e.g. emails) are collected, the researchers cannot inform the participants about further details of the study or about a possible breach of data.
